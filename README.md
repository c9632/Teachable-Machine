Teachable Theremin
===========================

This is a teachable 3-note Theremin with a changeable wave. To operate this theremin, you will need your right arm and your left hand. 

Put your right arm horizontally in front of the camera and you may play C4 by placing your arm at the lower section of your camera. Then D4 at the middle section of your camera. And lastly, E4 at the upper section of your camera. 

Your left hand controls the shape of the wave. A victory sign represents a sawtooth based waveform that I created. 
A full circle formed with 4 fingers and a thumb represents a sine wave.
